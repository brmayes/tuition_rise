  <h1>Tuition on the Rise</h1>
  <h3>How the tuition of the University of North Carolina's 16 university campuses have grown over the past decade.</h3>
    <p>
      Without a doubt, the cost of college tuition and fees nation-wide has been rising over time. The University of North Carolina's
      campuses are no different. Ten years ago, no UNC system school cost more than $4,360 for an in-state undergraduate student.
      Today, no UNC system school costs less than $4,656.
    </p>
    <p>
      The average cost of tuition and fees in the 2015-16 school year was $6,312.20, an increase of over three thousand dollars
      from the average rate in the 2004-05 school year.
    </p>
    <p>
      The priciest school in the UNC school system is currently NC State, with a price tag of about $8,407. The University of
      North Carolina at Chapel Hill trails closely with a cost of $8,334. In opposition, Elizabeth City State University is the
      least expensive costing only about $4,657.
    </p>
    <p>
      Over the last ten years, each of the universities saw at least an 84% increase in tuition and fees, if not more. The highest
      rate of change was Appalachian State, which increased 113%.

    1.7% and greater. The largest margin of change is East Carolina with a monetary increase of $416.00, which equals
    a 6.5% increase.
