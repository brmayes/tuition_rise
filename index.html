    <h1>Tuition on the Rise</h1>
    <h3>How the tuition of the University of North Carolina's 16 university campuses have grown over the past decade.</h3>
    <p>
      Without a doubt, the cost of college tuition and fees nation-wide has been rising over time. The University of North
      Carolina's campuses are no different. Ten years ago, no UNC system school cost more than $4,360 for an in-state
      undergraduate student. Today, no UNC system school costs less than $4,656.
    </p>
    <p>
      The average cost of tuition and fees in the 2015-16 school year was $6,312.20, an increase of over three thousand dollars
      from the average rate in the 2004-05 school year.
    </p>
    <p>
      The priciest school in the UNC school system is currently NC State, with a price tag of about $8,407. The University
      of North Carolina at Chapel Hill trails closely with a cost of $8,334. In opposition, Elizabeth City State University is
      the least expensive costing only about $4,657.
    </p>
    <p>
      Over the last ten years, each of the universities saw at least an 84% increase in tuition and fees, if not more.
      The highest rate of change was Appalachian State, which increased 113%.

      *Numbers are based on tuition and fees combined. If ever a reference to one, it includes the other.
    </p>
    <p>
      Numbers are growing rapidly, and are unlikely to stop. Proposals for the 2016-17 school year shows increases of 1.7%
      and greater. The largest margin of change is East Carolina with a monetary increase of $416.00, which equals a 6.5% increase.
